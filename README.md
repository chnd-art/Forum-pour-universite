# Discussion Forum

I developed a comprehensive forum web application using ASP.NET Core. The platform enables users to register or log in to access various features, such as adding, editing, deleting, or viewing questions and responses. Additionally, the application includes an email notification system that alerts users whenever a new response is added to their questions .
